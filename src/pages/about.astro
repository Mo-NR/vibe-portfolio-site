          My Story
        </h2>
        <p class="font-body text-lg text-white/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          I am a Mechanical Engineering graduate with a strong interest in how ideas move from concept to real, usable designs. My journey into engineering grew from a curiosity about how things work and developed through academic study, hands-on design projects, and practical problem-solving. During my degree, I became particularly drawn to design-focused engineering, where technical thinking meets creativity and real-world constraints.
        </p>
        <p class="font-body text-lg text-white/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Alongside my studies, I actively developed practical skills through CAD modelling, independent projects, and experimenting with modern digital tools. I enjoy learning by building, testing, and refining ideas, and this mindset shapes how I approach challenges—breaking them down logically and improving them through iteration. This website documents that journey and shows how my skills and interests continue to evolve.

          Background
        </h2>
        <p class="font-body text-lg text-white/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          My background is in Mechanical Engineering, with experience in engineering design, technical drawing, and BIM workflows. I have completed projects using AutoCAD and Revit, developing skills in creating accurate drawings, structured models, and clear design documentation.
        </p>
        <p class="font-body text-lg text-white/90 leading-relaxed">
          Through academic and personal projects, I have built experience in engineering design processes, CAD modelling, problem-solving, and presenting technical work clearly. I am particularly interested in how traditional engineering skills can be strengthened through efficient workflows, digital tools, and AI-assisted development.

          Current Focus
        </h2>
        <p class="font-body text-lg text-white/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          I am currently focused on developing my design capability and exploring modern "vibe coding" workflows that combine engineering thinking with AI tools. I am building projects in CAD, BIM, and web-based portfolios to showcase my work and learning process.
